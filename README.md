- 🔍 Identified missing values using `isnull().sum()`  
- 🧹 Handled missing values using **mean** (numeric) and **mode** (categorical)  
- 🗑️ Dropped irrelevant columns safely  
- 🧬 Removed duplicate records (if any)  
- 🔄 Converted datatypes where required  
- 🆕 Created a new feature: **Age_Category**

## 🧰 Tools Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🐼 Pandas  
- ☁️ Google Colab
